Please find below the artifacts discussed in our SEFM'15 submission.

## Availability
Melange source code is available on Github ([https://github.com/diverse-project/melange](https://github.com/diverse-project/melange)).

Our Jenkins server continuously builds the source code and produces and update site for Eclipse available on [https://ci.inria.fr/k3al/job/melange-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/plugins/fr.inria.diverse.melange.p2updatesite/target/site/](https://ci.inria.fr/k3al/job/melange-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/plugins/fr.inria.diverse.melange.p2updatesite/target/site/).


## Installation
This update site can be used to install Melange (Help -> Install New Software...) in the [Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-and-dsl-developers/lunasr2).

## Experiments
The [FSMs.zip](../static/FSMs.zip) archive contains all the projects necessary to the reproduction of our experiment. The project fr.inria.diverse.examples.fsm.main can be executed as a Java project with the enclosed launch configuration. The flow of execution is printed on the console and the results are created as PDF files in the output/ folder of the main project.

The model typing space integrating the 8 variants of finite-state machines can be found in the fr.inria.diverse.examples.fsm.main/src/finitestatemachines/FSM.melange file.
